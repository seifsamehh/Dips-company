              <h2>Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT)</h2>
              <p>
                is an advanced method of ultrasonic testing, which is widely
                used for nondestructive testing (NDT) in several industrial
                sectors, such as construction, pipelines, and power generation
                to detect discontinuities, cracks or flaws and thereby determine
                component quality, and also can be used for wall thickness
                measurements in conjunction with corrosion testing. A PAUT is
                more robust and easier to use than conventional single-element
                probes, providing improved efficiency, capturing hundreds of
                signals at once, and reducing the number of false alarms.PAUT
                provides a permanent record. And because PAUT can detect defects
                at the surface and into the volume of a weld (with no dead
                zone), it also gives information about the lateral position of a
                defect (depth and height).

                technology used in detecting flaws and corrosion in ferrous
                materials typically hidden under layers of coating,
                fireproofing, or insulation. It is a screening tool.It will
                detect generalized corrosion. Pulsed Eddy Current is a unique
                corrosion survey method that allows ferrous objects to be
                surveyed without the need to make contact with the surface.This
                means that measurements can be performed on objects covered with
                insulation, asbestos, fireproofing, concrete or coating.The high
                costs for removal of insulation can therefore be avoided.<br />

                Modified NDT utilize Ectane -2 Eddyfi equipment for IRIS Tube
                Inspection.The internal rotary inspection system (IRIS) is an
                ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) technique used to
                inspect tubes. IRIS is an ultrasonic technique that requires a
                couplant (water).Tubes under test must therefore first be
                flooded to use this technique. It is a technology that works on
                all materials, regardless of properties (suitable for ferrous
                and nonferrous materials). It provides very accurate wall
                thickness measurement results. IRIS is used in detection of
                corrosion, pitting and wall loss. It can detect both internal
                and external defects.

                Modified NDT utilize Ectane -2 Eddyfi equipment for MFL Tube
                Inspection. Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) is an electromagnetic
                non-destructive testing technique used to detect corrosion and
                pitting in ferromagnetic materials. MFL uses a powerful magnet
                to magnetize the conductive material under test. Where there are
                defects (corrosion or material loss), the magnetic field “leaks”
                from the conductive material. It is a fast inspection technique
                that is effective for aluminum-finned carbon steel tubes,
                because the magnetic field is almost completely unaffected by
                the presence of such fins.

                detecting corrosion, erosion, and pitting in ferromagnetic
                materials. NFT is perfect for fin-fan tube heat exchangers
                because eddy currents do not go through the wall of the tube. It
                can detect internal defects.

                non-destructive test method to detect corrosion on the pipe wall
                or plates concealed under support structures or structural
                shell. The special SRUT probe is placed away from the area of
                interest (generally concealed surface) to scan up to 1m of
                material length without losing adequate sensitivity. Annular
                rings under the Tanks shells are best inspected using Short
                Range Ultrasonic testing.

                Long Range Ultrasonic Testing is used to remotely analyze assets
                for corrosion and flaws over long distances without the need for
                direct contact. LRUT is used to rapidly inspect pipelines,
                piping systems, and other assets with minimal insulation
                removal. LRUT quickly localizes cracking and corrosion damage to
                pinpoint and characterize length and depth.

              <p>
                Radiographic Testing (RT) inspections use X-Ray or Gamma ray
                (Ir192-, Co60-) sources to view and assess the internal
                structure of an asset. RT is sensitive to corrosion, changes in
                thickness, voids, cracks, and material density changes, and is
                able to detect both surface and sub-surface defects with minimum
                surface preparation required. Radiographic Testing (RT)
                accurately locate, size, and identify the defects. It provides a
                permanent record of the inspection.

                bubbles as leakage gas passes through the solution). The main
                objective of the Vacuum box testing technique is to locate leaks
                in welds due to through-thickness discontinuities.

                surfaces using specialized tools and equipment. Holidays tests
                work on the concept of electrical conductivity. Metal substrates
                are excellent conductors of electricity, and therefore allow
                current to flow through them. On the other hand, many coatings
                are poor conductors of electricity and resist the flow of
                electricity. Using this principle, holiday tests use instruments
                to locate flaws in anticorrosive paints and coatings.

                Modified NDT utilize Online PSV testing calibration- AccuTest
                equipment. The old way of PSV/PRV testing could be summarized in
                one word: downtime.First, the plant went down, then valves were
                disassembled, and finally, the valves were transported offsite
                for testing. This way was time-consuming, costly and high risk.
                But using the AccuTEST System, PSV/PRV testing comes to you,
                right where the valves actually operate, without adjustment in
                operatingpressure which is time saver, cheaper and Lower

                <span>-</span> Reduces downtime. No need to place the plant
                off-line for a week and remove the valves, or sending them to an
                outside testing facility.<br />
                <span>-</span> Reduces loss of revenue by preventing the risk of
                safety valve damage during transportation for testing.<br />
                <span>-</span> No system discharge (No fuel costs, so improves
                the environmental conditions).<br />
                <span>-</span> No dismantling of the safety valves from the

                following a welding process. A post weld heat treatment is
                performed to alleviate residual stresses, increase the strength,
                increase or decrease the hardness, and reduce the risk of
                cracking. An array of heating processes can be used to carry out
